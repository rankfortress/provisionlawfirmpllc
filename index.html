	<p>
	Estate Planning</p>
	We work with clients to assess their unique estate planning goals and help them identify the plan that will best meet their goals. The planning process will address assets and ownership, digital property, trusted relationships, family dynamics, personal wishes and more.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Legacy Planning</p>
	Comprehensive estate planning must consider the whole person, not just the wealth that has been accumulated during one’s lifetime. It is important that each client be guided through the thought process of considering the legacy that his or her estate plan will leave after they’re gone. Whether it’s preserving family harmony, passing on personal values, supporting a charitable cause or something else, we will guide you through the process.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Incapacity Planning</p>
	No estate plan is complete without planning for the possibility of being rendered unable to make financial or personal decisions for yourself. Without this essential component of estate planning, loved ones can be left fighting for the right to take care of you and your finances in a costly and stressful court proceeding.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Cabin Succession Planning</p>
	The family cabin is a unique asset and must be treated as such. If you own a cabin and would like to pass it to the next generation during your lifetime or upon your death, then it is important that you make a legally binding plan for that shared ownership. We will address the management, voluntary and involuntary transfer of the cabin, systems for determining use and expense allocation, buy-sell provisions, creditor protection, ex-spouse protection and more.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Planning for Minor Children</p>
	Estate planning is crucial when minor children are involved. Parents have the privilege and responsibility of nominating a person to raise their children if they are unable to do so. They can also direct how and when their children will receive their assets, who will manage their children’s inheritance, and who can care for their children in the case of an emergency.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Planning for Seniors</p>
	We work with clients to build a portfolio of information that will allow elderly individuals and couples to stay at home longer. With some advanced planning, measures can be taken to assist the elderly and allow them to live safely and comfortably in their own homes.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Special Needs Planning</p>
	Public benefits are often available to a person with special needs. However, these benefits can be jeopardized by an inheritance or by owning assets that exceed permissible levels. Through special needs planning, it is possible to protect both the public benefits as well as the disabled person’s assets so that they can enjoy an enhanced standard of living. This type of planning is best done early, before an inheritance is passed to a disabled person, so we encourage you to act now if you have someone in your life with special needs.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Tax-Planning</p>
	Some estates are subject to estate tax, some are not. The tax laws are unpredictable and often changing. It is advisable to consult with an attorney to determine if tax-planning strategies are something you should be utilizing in your estate plan.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Planning for Blended Families</p>
	Do you and/or your spouse have children from a prior relationship that you would like to include in your estate plan? It is possible to financially protect your spouse after your death while also ensuring that your children will receive an immediate or eventual gift from your estate.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Charitable Giving and Planning</p>
	There are many reasons to include charitable giving in your gifting and or estate plan. All of us have benefited from the philanthropy of others in one way or another during our lifetimes. Whether there is a cause that you want to support, a legacy that you want to be remembered for, or a tax strategy that you could benefit from, charitable planning is something you should discuss with an experienced estate planning attorney.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Pet Planning</p>
	If your children are furry and four-legged and you want to be sure that they are provided for financially after your death, you may want to consider a pet trust. Any assets not used for the care of your pets after they’ve passed can be left to the person or charity of your choice.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Estate Administration/Probate</p>
	Probate is not merely the administration of a decedent’s estate; more importantly, it is the process of helping a grieved loved one navigate the court system in order to distribute assets in an efficient, timely and stress-free manner. We help loved ones through the probate process so that they can focus on other matters.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Guardianship / Conservatorship</p>
	If a person is unable to make financial or personal decisions for themselves, either because they are a minor or because they are incapacitated under the law, and they do not have an incapacity plan in place, a petition will need to be filed with the court seeking guardianship and/or conservatorship of that person. We represent family members seeking this appointment as well as family members objecting to the appointment.</p>
	</p>
	</p>
	Trust Administration</p>
	If you have been named as Trustee, you have a legal obligation and standard that you must follow. If you are looking for guidance to administer a trust, we will represent you in this process so that the terms of the instrument as well as state law are followed.</p>
